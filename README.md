# COSC-449-Honors-Putri-Leksono
The progress of Putri Leksono's Honors Thesis

This course consists of a research project in predictive modeling and agricultural optimization supervised
by Dr. Shan Du. The student must complete a research thesis at the end of this course and a public
presentation.

This thesis will explore the development of a predictive model to enhance agricultural productivity in Java,
Indonesia, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformer networks. The student will employ
remote sensing to predict crop yield based on available field images, then map this data with current weather
conditions in the area. This analysis will be conducted over several time intervals, leveraging LSTM and
transformer to forecast future yields. The study aims to find correlations between weather patterns, land
elevation, and crop yield through integrated data analysis. The output will include quantitative data on
weather and harvest predictions, derived from current production and climate data. The first objective is to
assess the performance of LSTM and transformer networks in forecasting yield and their impact on crop
production. The second objective is to refine the model by incorporating spatial and temporal data to
improve prediction accuracy. Research activities include literature review, data collection from Automatic
Weather Systems (AWS) and satellite imagery, model implementation, training, validation, and
performance evaluation, with a focus on developing a scalable solution for enhancing agricultural resilience.
